  <h2>Q: How is Tabalanche different from other extensions that save tabs, like OneTab?</h2>
  <p>I wrote Tabalanche to address some of my frustrations with OneTab:</p>
  <h3>Tabalanche doesn't slow down the more you use it</h3>
  <p>
  The technical design of OneTab means that, every time you use it to stash
  tabs, it takes <em>every tab you've ever saved</em> out of storage, adds your
  new tabs to those tabs, and sends <em>every single tab</em> back out,
  <em>every single time</em>. This isn't too slow when you're first using
  OneTab, and you only have a few hundred tabs - but, once you've been using it
  for a few months, saving fifty tabs a week or so, the slowness adds up. When
  you have several thousand tabs saved up, OneTab can freeze your entire
  browser, for minutes at a time, every time you try to save even a single tab
  (or even just open the browser, as OneTab loads all of your saved tabs at
  once for its start page).
  </p>
  <p>
  Tabalanche, in contrast, is written using a proper database that allows for
  each group of tabs to be saved or loaded individually, which means that, even
  after saving tens of thousands of tabs, Tabalanche responds within seconds,
  whether stashing a group or reading the list.
  </p>
  <h3>Tabalanche makes it easier to keep some tabs open</h3>
  <p>
  OneTab has two ways of interacting with it: the browser action button, which
  closes every tab in the window, and the right-click context menu, which
  exposes every action OneTab can take in a long, segmented list. This makes it
  so that, when looking to send only certain pages to OneTab, you have to
  either move a certain set of tabs to a new window - only so it can be closed
  by clicking the OneTab button - or opening a new tab and thinking through
  which sequence of items you need to click in the page to make what you want
  happen (and hope that you don't accidentally click the menu item
  <em>above</em> it and close all the <em>other</em> tabs by mistake).
  </p>
  <p>
  In Tabalanche, clicking the button opens a popup with four large, illustrated
  buttons for picking which tabs to stash, as well as a button to open the list
  of tabs that have previously been stashed. This way, you don't need to mess
  around with new windows or complex menus just to keep the tabs you need open.
  </p>
  <h3>Tabalanche doesn't make it easy to accidentally close everything<h3>
  <p>
  Having Tabalanche's stash options under a popup means that, if you
  accidentally click the button, you can easily back out before anything
  closes. In OneTab, if you accidentally click the OneTab button, every tab in
  the entire window will immediately be closed, without asking.
  </p>
  <!-- Also categorization and sync, but Tabalanche doesn't have those yet -->
  <h3>Tabalanche is open source</h3>
  <p>
  Having all these problems with OneTab, I knew I could have fixed it to work
  better - but, not only does OneTab not have any way for its users to
  contribute improvements, its source code uses obfuscatory techniques to make
  it harder for outsiders to work with it.
  </p>
  <p>
  Tabalanche is
  <a href="https://github.com/tabalanche/tabalanche-extension">fully open
  source on GitHub</a>, so any user wanting to contribute improvements can
  suggest them via issue or pull request.
